      "source": "Question 1\nA 7-month-old infant is brought in with a spiral fracture of the humerus. The caregiver states the injury occurred while \"the baby was rolling around on the bed.\" Which of the following is the\u00a0most appropriate response?\nA. Reassure the caregiver that this is a common accident\nB. Refer to orthopaedics for cast placement only\nC. Recognize this injury as suspicious in a non-ambulatory child and notify safeguarding services\nD. Schedule outpatient follow-up in one week\nE. Accept the explanation and discharge the infant\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Recognize this injury as suspicious in a non-ambulatory child and notify safeguarding services\nExplanation:\u00a0Spiral fractures can occur in accidental trauma, but in a\u00a0non-ambulatory infant (i.e., one who cannot yet roll, crawl, or walk), such injuries raise significant concern. These fractures require a\u00a0torsional (twisting) force, which is unlikely to occur from passive movement like rolling. Therefore, this presentation must raise red flags for\u00a0non-accidental trauma. Safeguarding services (social work, child protection team) should be notified\u00a0immediately. Early action can prevent further harm or fatality.\nReferences:\nRoyal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH),\u00a0Child Protection Companion, 2013.\n\nWhy other options are inappropriate:\nA. Reassure the caregiver:\nThis may overlook potential abuse and risk further harm to the infant.\nB. Refer to orthopaedics for cast only:\nWhile orthopaedic management is needed, this ignores the safeguarding concern.\nD. Schedule outpatient follow-up:\nDelays in evaluation and safeguarding involvement may endanger the child.\nE. Accept explanation and discharge:\nDischarging without investigation fails to protect the infant and breaches safeguarding responsibilities.\n\nQuestion 2\nWhich of the following injury patterns is most suggestive of non-accidental injury in a child?\nA. Linear forehead bruise from a table corner\nB. Bilateral metaphyseal corner fractures\nC. Toddler\u2019s fracture of the tibia\nD. Greenstick fracture of the ulna after falling from a bicycle\nE. Small superficial abrasion on the shin\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Bilateral metaphyseal corner fractures\nExplanation:\u00a0Metaphyseal corner fractures\u00a0(also known as\u00a0classic metaphyseal lesions, or CMLs) are\u00a0highly specific\u00a0indicators of non-accidental trauma (NAT), particularly in infants and young children who are not yet ambulatory. These fractures occur at the growing ends of long bones, specifically at the\u00a0metaphysis, and involve a small piece of bone being avulsed due to\u00a0shearing, pulling, or twisting forces.\nThese forces are\u00a0not typically encountered during accidental trauma\u00a0(e.g., simple falls) but rather are\u00a0consistent with abuse, such as violent\u00a0shaking, jerking of limbs, or\u00a0forcibly pulling\u00a0on the child\u2019s arms or legs.\nReferences:\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect. Pediatrics. 2000;105(6):1345\u20131348.\n\n\nWhy the other options are less suspicious of NAI:\nA. Linear forehead bruise from a table corner:\nBruising on the forehead is a\u00a0common injury\u00a0in toddlers learning to walk and is consistent with an\u00a0accidental fall, especially if the story matches the developmental stage.\nC. Toddler\u2019s fracture of the tibia:\nThis is a\u00a0spiral fracture\u00a0of the tibia often seen in children aged 9 months to 3 years, typically due to\u00a0low-energy twisting injuries\u00a0like sliding or tripping while walking or running.\u00a0It is not specific for NAI.\nD. Greenstick fracture of the ulna after falling from a bicycle:\nGreenstick fractures are\u00a0incomplete fractures\u00a0seen in children due to the flexibility of their bones. This pattern is\u00a0typical of accidental trauma, especially with a clear, witnessed mechanism like a bike fall.\nE. Small superficial abrasion on the shin:\nThese are\u00a0very common injuries\u00a0in mobile children and not concerning in isolation. Superficial abrasions are expected with normal play.\nQuestion 3\nA 6-month-old infant is brought in with seizures. CT scan reveals subdural hematoma. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral retinal haemorrhages. There is no reported history of trauma. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Accidental fall from a sofa\nB. Shaken baby syndrome\nC. Febrile seizure\nD. Vitamin K deficiency\nE. Coagulopathy\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Shaken baby syndrome\nExplanation:\u00a0The\u00a0triad of findings\u2014subdural hematoma,\u00a0retinal haemorrhages, and\u00a0absence of adequate trauma history\u2014is\u00a0highly suggestive of abusive head trauma (AHT), also known as\u00a0shaken baby syndrome (SBS).\n1. Subdural Hematoma:\nSeen on CT in infants who have been subjected to\u00a0violent shaking, causing rupture of\u00a0bridging veins\u00a0between the brain and dura mater.\nSubdural hematomas in this age group\u00a0rarely occur accidentally, especially without an appropriate trauma history.\nThe\u00a0infant brain\u00a0is particularly vulnerable due to a\u00a0relatively large head, weak neck muscles, and\u00a0incomplete myelination.\n\"Subdural hematoma is the most common intracranial lesion found in abusive head trauma.\"\n\u2014\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics. Pediatrics. 2001;108(1):206\u2013210.\n2. Retinal Hemorrhages:\nBilateral, multilayered retinal hemorrhages, especially in the\u00a0posterior pole and extending to the periphery, are\u00a0strong indicators of inflicted trauma.\nThese occur due to\u00a0acceleration-deceleration forces\u00a0and\u00a0increased intracranial pressure.\n\u201cRetinal hemorrhages are seen in over 80% of cases of shaken baby syndrome and are rare in accidental trauma.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Levin AV. Retinal hemorrhages and child abuse: the evidence. Curr Opin Ophthalmol. 2010;21(5):460\u2013466.\n3. Seizures:\nSeizures are a common presenting symptom in abusive head trauma due to\u00a0intracranial bleeding and brain injury.\nSeizures in infants\u00a0without fever or trauma\u00a0always warrant neuroimaging and further investigation for abuse.\n\n\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\nA. Accidental fall from a sofa:\nLow-height falls (under 1.5 meters) are\u00a0unlikely to cause subdural hematoma with retinal haemorrhages. If the injury is\u00a0disproportionate to the history provided, child abuse must be considered.\nC. Febrile seizure:\nThese occur in older infants and toddlers (typically\u00a06 months to 5 years) and are\u00a0generalized tonic-clonic seizures associated with fever\u2014not\u00a0subdural bleeding or retinal haemorrhages.\nD. Vitamin K deficiency:\nCan lead to\u00a0bleeding, especially in newborns, but this usually presents earlier (within the first few weeks of life), and the\u00a0bleeding pattern\u00a0is typically more generalized (e.g., GI or skin, not just intracranial and retinal).\nE. Coagulopathy:\nWhile coagulopathies can cause bleeding, they usually present with a\u00a0history of bleeding tendency\u00a0(e.g., easy bruising, mucosal bleeding) and would\u00a0not explain the specific pattern\u00a0of\u00a0bilateral retinal haemorrhages and subdural hematoma.\n\n\nQuestion 4\nWhich of the following is the\u00a0most appropriate next step\u00a0when child abuse is suspected in a clinical setting?\nA. Document findings in the notes and observe\nB. Confront the caregiver immediately\nC. Notify child protective services or the safeguarding team\nD. Discharge the child with close follow-up\nE. Wait for confirmatory imaging before acting\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Notify child protective services or the safeguarding team\n\nExplanation:\u00a0When child abuse is suspected, the\u00a0immediate priority is to ensure the child\u2019s safety\u00a0and initiate a thorough, multi-disciplinary safeguarding process.\nWhy notify child protective services or safeguarding team?\nLegal obligation:\nHealthcare professionals are\u00a0mandated reporters\u00a0in many countries, meaning they are legally required to\u00a0report any reasonable suspicion of child abuse\u00a0to the appropriate authorities.\nChild safety:\nEarly involvement of safeguarding teams ensures\u00a0prompt assessment, investigation, and protection of the child. Delays can increase the risk of further harm and death. \nExpert assessment:\nThe safeguarding team usually includes social workers, paediatricians, and sometimes law enforcement, providing a comprehensive approach.\n\u201cHealthcare professionals should report suspected abuse promptly and share concerns with appropriate child protection agencies without delay.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) Child Protection Companion, 2020\n\nWhy the other options are inappropriate or insufficient?\nA. Document findings in the notes and observe:\nWhile documentation is essential,\u00a0observation alone risks ongoing harm\u00a0if the child remains in a dangerous environment. Action must follow suspicion, not just documentation.\nB. Confront the caregiver immediately:\nConfronting the caregiver can\u00a0escalate the situation or cause the caregiver to flee, making it harder to protect the child and investigate safely. The approach should be cautious and often led by social services or law enforcement.\nD. Discharge the child with close follow-up:\nDischarging without intervention\u00a0places the child at risk. Follow-up alone is insufficient when abuse is suspected.\nE. Wait for confirmatory imaging before acting:\nWaiting for investigations delays intervention and\u00a0does not remove the legal responsibility to report suspicion immediately. Imaging helps with diagnosis but should not delay safeguarding actions.\nQuestion 5\nWhich of the following injuries is\u00a0least\u00a0likely to be associated with non-accidental injury in children?\nA. Bucket-handle (corner) fractures\nB. Posterior rib fractures\nC. Scald burns with clear immersion lines\nD. Bruising over bony prominences in toddlers\nE. Retinal haemorrhages\nAnswer:\u00a0D. Bruising over bony prominences in toddlers\nExplanation:\u00a0Toddlers who are active and learning to walk frequently sustain minor accidental bruises, especially over bony prominences like the shins, knees, forehead, and elbows. These are expected and considered part of normal childhood play and exploration. Accidental bruises tend to be found on the front of the body, over bony areas where children are prone to bumping during normal activity.\nReferences:\n\u201cBruising over bony prominences in mobile children is common and usually accidental.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Pierce MC, et al. Clinical characteristics that distinguish abusive from nonabusive bruises in young children. Pediatrics. 2010.\n\n\nWhy other options are more indicative of NAI:\nA. Bucket-handle (corner) fractures:\nHighly specific for abuse, resulting from\u00a0shearing forces during shaking or twisting. Commonly seen in infants who are non-ambulatory.\nB. Posterior rib fractures:\nClassic injury due to\u00a0forceful squeezing or chest compression, rarely caused by accidental trauma in infants.\nC. Scald burns with clear immersion lines:\nBurns with\u00a0well-demarcated edges, uniform depth, and clear \u201clines of demarcation\u201d\u00a0suggest forced immersion in hot liquid, consistent with abuse.\nE. Retinal haemorrhages:\nStrongly associated with\u00a0shaken baby syndrome\u00a0and abusive head trauma; very uncommon in accidental injuries.\n\n\nQuestion 6\nA 4-year-old child presents with bruising in various stages of healing. Which of the following patterns is most concerning for non-accidental injury?\nA. Bruises over knees and elbows\nB. Linear bruises on the back and buttocks\nC. Small bruises over shins\nD. Bruising from seatbelt marks in a car crash\nE. A single forehead bruise from running into a door\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Linear bruises on the back and buttocks\nExplanation:\u00a0Linear bruises on the back and buttocks are not most concerning because: \nUnusual location for accidental bruising:\nThe back and buttocks are\u00a0areas less likely to be injured accidentally\u00a0during normal play, especially in ambulatory children. Accidental bruises are typically found on\u00a0bony prominences at the front of the body, like knees, shins, and elbows.\nLinear pattern suggests impact with an object:\nLinear bruises can be caused by\u00a0blunt objects such as sticks, belts, rods, or straps. This pattern of injury is consistent with\u00a0intentional infliction of trauma.\nBruising in various stages of healing:\nMultiple bruises of different ages suggest\u00a0repeated episodes of trauma, a red flag for ongoing abuse.\n\u201cBruising in protected areas such as the back and buttocks, especially with linear or patterned marks, is highly suspicious for abuse.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Jenny C.\u00a0Child Abuse and Neglect: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Evidence. 2010.\n.\n\nWhy the other options are less concerning or consistent with accidental trauma:\nA. Bruises over knees and elbows:\nCommonly seen in active children and toddlers learning to walk or run; usually accidental.\nC. Small bruises over shins:\nSimilar to knees and elbows, these are typical accidental bruises from normal activities.\nD. Bruising from seatbelt marks in a car crash:\nExpected and consistent with history of trauma in a car accident; not suspicious if the history matches the injury.\nE. A single forehead bruise from running into a door:\nCommon minor injury, especially in toddlers and young children, and consistent with the history.\n\nQuestion 7\nWhich radiological investigation is\u00a0most appropriate\u00a0when non-accidental injury is suspected in a child under 2 years of age?\nA. MRI of the head\nB. Ultrasound of abdomen\nC. Skeletal survey\nD. Bone scan\nE. CT scan of abdomen\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Skeletal survey\nExplanation:\u00a0A skeletal survey is standard in children under 2 when NAI is suspected, as it can identify occult fractures. Explained below\nPurpose:\nA skeletal survey is a\u00a0systematic series of X-rays\u00a0of the entire skeleton. It is designed to\u00a0detect both recent and old fractures, including occult (hidden) fractures that are not clinically apparent.\nIdentification of classic abusive fractures:\nThe skeletal survey can identify highly specific injuries for abuse, such as\u00a0metaphyseal corner (bucket-handle) fractures, posterior rib fractures, and fractures in various stages of healing.\nGuidelines:\nInternational child protection guidelines recommend a skeletal survey as\u00a0first-line imaging\u00a0when abuse is suspected in infants and young children under 2 years.\n\u201cThe skeletal survey is essential in the assessment of suspected physical abuse in children under 2 years, to detect occult fractures and establish the extent of injury.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Royal College of Radiologists and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidelines, 2014.\n\nWhy other options are less appropriate:\nA. MRI of the head:\nMRI is excellent for\u00a0brain injury evaluation, especially for suspected abusive head trauma, but is\u00a0not a screening tool for skeletal injuries.\nB. Ultrasound of abdomen:\nUseful for evaluating abdominal organ injury, but\u00a0not for detecting fractures.\nD. Bone scan:\nBone scintigraphy can detect fractures, but it is\u00a0less specific\u00a0and less widely used than skeletal survey. It is sometimes used as an adjunct when skeletal survey is inconclusive.\nE. CT scan of abdomen:\nUseful for detecting internal organ injury but\u00a0does not identify skeletal injuries\u00a0and involves higher radiation exposure than other modalities.\n\nQuestion 8\nA 2-month-old presents with a femur fracture. There is no history of trauma, and the baby is not yet rolling over. What is the\u00a0most important initial step?\nA. Order a full blood count and calcium\nB. Refer to orthopedic surgery for traction\nC. Begin vitamin D supplementation\nD. Initiate a full safeguarding evaluation including a skeletal survey\nE. Observe the child overnight in hospital\nAnswer:\u00a0D. Initiate a full safeguarding evaluation including a skeletal survey\nExplanation:\u00a0Infants under 6 months who are not yet mobile (rolling, crawling, or walking) are very unlikely to sustain fractures accidentally, especially long bone fractures like the femur. In this context, a femur fracture without a history of trauma is a red flag for possible abuse. The absence of an adequate trauma explanation warrants a thorough child protection investigation.\nThis imaging series will identify other occult fractures that might not be clinically apparent, including metaphyseal fractures and rib fractures that are characteristic of abuse. Safeguarding evaluation involves paediatricians, social workers, and possibly law enforcement to assess the child's safety and well-being.\nReferences\nKemp AM, et al. Which injuries may indicate child abuse? A systematic review. Arch Dis Child. 2014;99(2):117-123.\nRoyal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Child Protection Companion. 2020.\n\nWhy the other options are less appropriate as first steps:\nA. Order a full blood count and calcium:\nWhile it\u2019s reasonable to consider metabolic bone disease or bleeding disorders, these tests alone do not exclude abuse and do not address immediate safeguarding concerns.\nB. Refer to orthopaedic surgery for traction:\nOrthopaedic management is necessary for fracture treatment but should\u00a0occur after ensuring the child is safe and that the cause of injury is investigated.\nC. Begin vitamin D supplementation:\nVitamin D deficiency could cause fractures but is unlikely without other signs such as rickets or biochemical abnormalities; more importantly, abuse must first be ruled out.\nE. Observe the child overnight in hospital:\nObservation does not address the need for a safeguarding investigation, which is urgent to prevent further harm.\n\nQuestion 9\nWhich of the following burn patterns is\u00a0most suspicious\u00a0for inflicted injury?\nA. Asymmetric splash burns on the chest\nB. Circular cigarette burns on the arm\nC. Burn from hot soup spill on lap\nD. Reddened palms after touching a stove\nE. Mild sunburn on the shoulders\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Circular cigarette burns on the arm\nExplanation:\u00a0Discrete, uniform burns like cigarette burns are highly suspicious for abuse. Accidental cigarette burns tend to be\u00a0superficial and irregular, often occurring when someone flinches or pulls away. In contrast, inflicted cigarette burns suggest\u00a0deliberate contact and sustained pressure, which children do not tolerate passively.\n\nWhy the other options are less suspicious:\nA. Asymmetric splash burns on the chest:\nThese are often\u00a0accidental, commonly caused by toddlers pulling down hot liquids. The irregular pattern and asymmetry are typical of such injuries.\nC. Burn from hot soup spill on lap:\nThis pattern may occur\u00a0accidentally\u00a0when a child spills a bowl or cup of hot liquid. Usually irregular in shape with varying depth.\nD. Reddened palms after touching a stove:\nThough painful, this is often\u00a0accidental\u00a0in curious toddlers who momentarily touch a hot surface. Usually presents as\u00a0superficial erythema, not deep burns.\nE. Mild sunburn on the shoulders:\nVery common and entirely\u00a0non-suspicious\u00a0unless accompanied by unusual patterns or in non-sun-exposed areas (which would be rare).\n\n\nQuestion 10\nWhich of the following is a common\u00a0perpetrator\u00a0in cases of non-accidental injury?\nA. Stranger\nB. Friend\nC. Primary caregiver\nD. Teacher\nE. Healthcare worker\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Primary caregiver\nExplanation:\u00a0Epidemiological data consistently show\u00a0that the majority of non-accidental injuries (NAI) are inflicted by individuals\u00a0closest to the child, typically\u00a0parents or primary caregivers\u00a0(e.g., biological parents, stepparents, or live-in partners). These individuals are:\nMost frequently present\u00a0with the child,\nIn control of the child\u2019s environment, and\nOften responsible for discipline or caregiving, which may escalate into abusive behaviour in high-stress or dysfunctional settings.\nReferences: \n\u201cThe vast majority of abused children are harmed by someone they know and trust\u2014most commonly a parent or parental figure.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0World Health Organization, Child Maltreatment Factsheet, 2020\n\nWhy the other options are less likely:\nA. Stranger:\nWhile stranger abuse is possible (e.g., abduction, sexual abuse), it is\u00a0rare\u00a0in cases of\u00a0physical abuse or NAI, especially in infants and toddlers.\nB. Friend:\nChildren\u2019s peers or friends may be involved in fights or accidents, but not typically in\u00a0systematic or intentional injury\u00a0consistent with abuse.\nD. Teacher:\nWhile institutional abuse can occur,\u00a0teachers are rarely responsible\u00a0for the types of injuries typically seen in NAI. Teachers are often\u00a0key reporters, not perpetrators.\nE. Healthcare worker:\nAbuse by healthcare professionals is exceedingly rare and typically falls under\u00a0medical misconduct or neglect, not physical NAI.\n\n\nQuestion 11\nWhich of the following statements is\u00a0true\u00a0regarding bruises in infants?\nA. Any bruising in a non-mobile infant is normal\nB. Bruising is common in infants under 6 months\nC. Bruising in non-mobile infants should always raise suspicion\nD. Bruising is never a concern in any child\nE. Bruising over shins in a crawling infant is highly suspicious\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Bruising in non-mobile infants should always raise suspicion\nExplanation:\u00a0Non-mobile infants rarely bruise; any such finding should prompt consideration of abuse.\n\nWhy the other statements are incorrect:\nA. Any bruising in a non-mobile infant is normal:\n\u274c False. It is\u00a0abnormal\u00a0in non-mobile infants and often a\u00a0red flag\u00a0for abuse.\nB. Bruising is common in infants under 6 months:\n\u274c False. Bruising is\u00a0uncommon\u00a0in infants under 6 months unless they are mobile. If present, it should raise\u00a0safeguarding concerns.\nD. Bruising is never a concern in any child:\n\u274c False. Bruising can be\u00a0accidental in older children, but location, pattern, and context matter. Bruises in unusual places or without a clear explanation are always concerning.\nE. Bruising over shins in a crawling infant is highly suspicious:\n\u274c False. Shins are\u00a0common sites for accidental bruising\u00a0in mobile children. Bruises over\u00a0bony prominences\u00a0in active toddlers are usually\u00a0benign.\n\n\nQuestion 12\nA 3-year-old presents with a scald burn with a clear \"stocking\" distribution on both legs. What is the most likely cause?\nA. Accidental hot water splash\nB. Intentional immersion in hot water\nC. Allergic reaction\nD. Contact dermatitis\nE. Infection\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Intentional immersion in hot water\nExplanation:\u00a0 \"Stocking\" distribution burns\u00a0refer to sharply demarcated scald injuries affecting both legs in a\u00a0symmetrical pattern, often extending from the feet up to the knees (like wearing socks or stockings). This pattern is\u00a0highly suspicious\u00a0for\u00a0forced immersion, where the child is held in hot water (e.g., in a bathtub or sink),\u00a0unable to escape. These burns have the following characteristics:\nHave\u00a0clear upper borders\u00a0(line of demarcation),\nAre often\u00a0bilaterally symmetrical, and\nMay involve\u00a0sparing in skin folds\u00a0or areas pressed against a cooler surface (known as \"zebra stripes\" or \"donut hole\" sign).\n\n\n Why the other options are incorrect:\nA. Accidental hot water splash:\nTypically produces\u00a0irregular, asymmetric burns\u00a0with\u00a0drip or splash patterns, not symmetrical, well-defined borders.\nC. Allergic reaction:\nWould present with\u00a0rash or hives, not burns or blistering.\nD. Contact dermatitis:\nUsually itchy and\u00a0diffuse, often triggered by irritants/allergens\u2014not consistent with full-thickness burns or symmetrical scalds.\nE. Infection:\nMay cause redness, warmth, and swelling but not\u00a0acute scald burns\u00a0with defined immersion lines.\n\n\n\nQuestion 13\nA child has multiple fractures in various stages of healing. What is the\u00a0next best step\u00a0in management?\nA. Discharge home with NSAIDs\nB. Reassure parents and arrange follow-up\nC. Refer to orthopaedic surgeon\nD. Report to safeguarding authorities and admit the child\nE. Treat pain and schedule outpatient review\nAnswer:\u00a0D. Report to safeguarding authorities and admit the child\nExplanation:\u00a0Multiple fractures at different stages raise significant concern for abuse; protection is the priority. This pattern indicates that:\nThe child has been\u00a0injured on more than one occasion, and\nThe\u00a0caregiver has either failed to seek timely medical care, or\nThere is a\u00a0pattern of inflicted injury\u00a0consistent with physical abuse.\nThe priority is\u00a0child safety\u00a0and\u00a0legal safeguarding with immediate admission\u00a0to hospital allows for safety and further medical evaluation, reporting to safeguarding authorities (e.g., child protective services or local safeguarding team)\u00a0is a\u00a0legal and ethical obligation\u00a0for healthcare providers, and a full\u00a0child protection workup\u00a0is indicated: skeletal survey, retinal exam, head imaging (if <2 years), and multidisciplinary review.\nReferences:\n \uf0b7  Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.\u00a0Child Protection Companion. 2020.\n\uf0b7  American Academy of Pediatrics.\u00a0Evaluating children with fractures for child physical abuse.\u00a0Pediatrics. 2014;133(2):e477\u2013e489.\n\n Why the other options are incorrect:\nA. Discharge home with NSAIDs:\nDangerous. Discharging a potentially abused child may result in further harm or death.\nB. Reassure parents and arrange follow-up:\nInappropriate. This delays intervention and fails to protect the child.\nC. Refer to orthopaedic surgeon:\nWhile orthopaedic input may be needed,\u00a0safeguarding takes precedence\u00a0and should occur\u00a0immediately, not just a specialty referral.\nE. Treat pain and schedule outpatient review:\nFails to address the underlying\u00a0safeguarding risk\u00a0and puts the child at continued risk of abuse.\nQuestion 14\nIn areas affected by armed conflict, which factor most increases the risk of non-accidental injury (NAI) in children?\nA. Increased access to healthcare services\nB. Disruption of family and social support systems\nC. Improved child protection laws\nD. Stable housing and schooling\nE. Enhanced nutritional programs\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Disruption of family and social support systems\nExplanation:\u00a0Armed conflict and war create\u00a0stressful environments\u00a0for families and communities. Key risk factors linked to increased\u00a0non-accidental injury (NAI)\u00a0in children during conflict include:\nDisruption of family units and social support\u00a0\u2014 loss of caregivers, displacement, and breakdown of community networks reduce supervision and increase vulnerability.\nIncreased caregiver stress and mental health issues\u00a0\u2014 poverty, trauma, and insecurity may increase risk of abuse.\nOverburdened or destroyed healthcare and social services\u00a0\u2014 limiting access to protective interventions.\nChildren in conflict zones are at higher risk of\u00a0neglect, physical abuse, and exploitation, including NAI. Protective systems such as schools and child welfare services are often compromised, increasing risk.\nReferences:\nUNICEF.\u00a0The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children. UNICEF Report, 2016.\nWHO.\u00a0Child Abuse and Neglect in Humanitarian Settings, 2018.\n\nWhy the other options are less likely:\nA. Increased access to healthcare services:\nRare in war zones; typically healthcare access decreases.\nC. Improved child protection laws:\nWhile important, enforcement is often weak or absent during conflict.\nD. Stable housing and schooling:\nUsually disrupted during war, increasing risks.\nE. Enhanced nutritional programs:\nNutritional aid helps overall health but does not directly reduce NAI risk without protective frameworks.\n\n\nQuestion 15\nA 7-month-old infant presents with posterior rib fractures and no trauma history. What mechanism likely explains these findings?\nA. Rolling off a bed\nB. Direct blow during a fall\nC. High-impact car crash\nD. Forceful chest compression from abuse\nE. Congenital bone disease\nAnswer:\u00a0D. Forceful chest compression from abuse\nExplanation:\u00a0Posterior rib fractures are strongly associated with squeezing the thorax in physical abuse. In this mechanism the ribs are pushed against the vertebral column, leading to posterior fractures at or near the costovertebral junction. This action often happens during shaken baby syndrome or other forms of blunt force trauma. \nReferences: \n\"Posterior rib fractures are extremely rare in accidental trauma and highly specific for abuse, particularly in infants.\" \u2014 American Academy of Pediatrics, 2014\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\nA. Rolling off a bed:\nTypically results in\u00a0minor injuries\u00a0such as soft tissue swelling or a single linear skull fracture\u2014not posterior rib fractures.\nB. Direct blow during a fall:\nEven in falls from moderate height,\u00a0rib fractures are rare in infants\u00a0because their bones are pliable. If they do occur, they are usually\u00a0lateral, not\u00a0posterior.\nC. High-impact car crash:\nMay cause rib fractures in older children, but in a\u00a0properly restrained infant, posterior rib fractures remain\u00a0unusual, and such trauma would usually be\u00a0reported or witnessed.\nE. Congenital bone disease (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta):\nWhile such conditions may predispose to fractures, they\u00a0rarely cause isolated posterior rib fractures\u00a0without other signs (e.g., blue sclerae, multiple long bone fractures, family history).\n\nQuestion 16\nWhat is the\u00a0most important role\u00a0of the healthcare provider when child abuse is suspected?\nA. Treat the visible injuries only\nB. Confront the suspected abuser directly\nC. Ensure the child\u2019s immediate safety\nD. Wait for law enforcement\nE. Avoid documenting details until confirmed\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Ensure the child\u2019s immediate safety\nExplanation:\u00a0Child safety is paramount. Immediate documentation and referral are essential.\nWhen child abuse is suspected, the\u00a0most urgent and critical responsibility\u00a0of the healthcare provider is to\u00a0ensure the child's immediate safety.\nThis includes:\nRemoving the child from harm\u2019s way\u00a0(e.g., admitting to hospital or ensuring safe supervision)\nNotifying child protection/safeguarding services immediately\nInitiating a multidisciplinary evaluation\u00a0(including paediatricians, social workers, and safeguarding teams)\nDocumenting findings accurately and thoroughly\nThe provider is\u00a0not required to confirm the abuse, only to\u00a0suspect\u00a0it and act to protect the child.\nReferences: \nNICE Guideline NG76.\u00a0Child abuse and neglect. 2017.\n\n Why the other options are incorrect:\nA. Treat the visible injuries only:\nIncomplete. Treating physical injuries is essential but\u00a0not sufficient\u2014protection\u00a0from further harm is the priority.\nB. Confront the suspected abuser directly:\nNot advisable. This may\u00a0increase risk to the child,\u00a0jeopardize the investigation, and is not the provider's role.\nD. Wait for law enforcement:\nDangerous delay.\u00a0Safeguarding referrals\u00a0must be initiated by the clinician without waiting for police.\nE. Avoid documenting details until confirmed:\nIncorrect.\u00a0Accurate, objective documentation\u00a0of\u00a0history, physical findings, and concerns\u00a0is\u00a0crucial\u00a0and should be done\u00a0immediately, regardless of confirmation.\n\nQuestion 17\nWhich of the following is\u00a0most consistent\u00a0with accidental injury?\nA. Bruises over soft parts of the body\nB. Symmetrical burns\nC. Fracture inconsistent with developmental stage\nD. Single bruise over the forehead in a toddler\nE. Patterned bruises\nAnswer:\u00a0D. Single bruise over the forehead in a toddler\nExplanation:\u00a0Toddlers who are learning to walk or run frequently fall, often forward, leading to isolated bruises on the forehead, especially over the frontal bone. These injuries:\nAre usually singular\nOccur over bony prominences\nAre consistent with the child\u2019s developmental stage and activities\nReferences:\n\u201cBruising over bony areas like the forehead, shins, or knees in mobile toddlers is often accidental and expected.\u201d\u2014 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health\n\nWhy the other options are more suspicious for\u00a0non-accidental injury (NAI):\nA. Bruises over soft parts of the body\nSuspicious \u2014 Soft tissues like the\u00a0abdomen, buttocks, cheeks, neck, or inner thighs\u00a0are\u00a0not common sites for accidental bruising, especially in non-mobile infants.\nB. Symmetrical burns\nHighly suspicious \u2014 Symmetrical or\u00a0\u201cglove\u201d or \u201cstocking\u201d distribution\u00a0burns often suggest\u00a0forced immersion\u00a0in hot water (a form of inflicted injury).\nC. Fracture inconsistent with developmental stage\nConcerning \u2014 For example, a\u00a0femur fracture in a non-ambulatory infant\u00a0is unlikely to occur accidentally and should prompt investigation.\nE. Patterned bruises\nRed flag \u2014 Bruises with\u00a0recognizable patterns\u00a0(e.g. loop marks, handprints, belt buckles) strongly suggest\u00a0inflicted trauma\u00a0from an object.\n\nQuestion 18\nA 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with a spiral fracture of the right femur. His mother reports he fell while playing. Which of the following features most strongly raises suspicion of non-accidental injury?\nA. The child has a normal developmental history\nB. Spiral fracture in a non-ambulatory child\nC. Mother appears distressed and anxious\nD. No external bruising noted\nE. The child cries when handled\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Spiral fracture in a non-ambulatory child\nExplanation:\u00a0Spiral fractures may occur accidentally, but in non-ambulatory children (e.g., not yet walking), any fracture raises concern for NAI.\n\nWhy the other options are less indicative of abuse:\nA. The child has a normal developmental history:\nThis alone doesn\u2019t exclude abuse. Developmental history helps assess mobility but is not definitive without considering fracture context.\nC. Mother appears distressed and anxious:\nParental distress is common and does not necessarily correlate with abuse.\nD. No external bruising noted:\nAbsence of bruising does not exclude abuse, as fractures can occur without visible skin injuries.\nE. The child cries when handled:\nExpected behaviour in pain and not specific for abuse.\n\n\nQuestion 19\nWhich age group is most commonly affected by fracture from non-accidental injury (NAI) in children?\nA. Newborns (0\u20131 month)\nB. Infants under 1 year\nC. Toddlers (2\u20134 years)\nD. School-aged children (5\u201312 years)\nE. Adolescents (13\u201318 years)\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Infants under 1 year\nExplanation:\u00a0Abuse and NAI can occur at any age. Studies show that the\u00a0peak incidence of NAI\u00a0occurs between\u00a03 and 12 months of age.\n\uf0b7  This age group:\nCannot verbalize or defend themselves\nHas limited mobility, so injuries are less likely to be accidental\nIs more dependent on caregivers, increasing risk when caregivers are stressed or lack support\nStudies show that the\u00a0peak incidence of NAI\u00a0occurs between\u00a03 and 9 months of age.\nReference:\nKemp AM, Dunstan F, Harrison S, Morris S, Mann M, Rolfe K, Maguire S.\u00a0Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: systematic review. BMJ. 2008;337:a1518. doi:10.1136/bmj.a1518.\n\nQuestion 20\nA 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with multiple bruises. Which of the following lab tests may be helpful in distinguishing abuse from medical conditions?\nA. LFTs\nB. Coagulation profile\nC. Renal function tests\nD. Blood glucose\nE. CRP\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Coagulation profile\nExplanation:\u00a0Multiple bruises in a child raise concerns for\u00a0non-accidental injury (NAI)\u00a0but also for\u00a0medical conditions\u00a0that can cause easy bruising. Bleeding and clotting disorders\u00a0such as:\nHemophilia A or B\nVon Willebrand disease\nPlatelet function defects\nVitamin K deficiency\nOther coagulopathies\ncan present with bruising that\u00a0mimics physical abuse. Identifying or excluding bleeding disorders is critical to avoid misdiagnosing abuse and ensure appropriate treatment.\n\nWhy the other options are less relevant:\nA. LFTs (Liver function tests):\nMay be abnormal in liver disease which can cause coagulopathy but are not first-line for bruising.\nC. Renal function tests:\nNot directly related to bruising or bleeding tendencies.\nD. Blood glucose:\nHypoglycaemia does not cause bruising.\nE. CRP (C-reactive protein):\nMarker of inflammation/infection; not related to bleeding or bruising.\n\n",

      "source": "Question 1\nA 7-month-old infant is brought in with a spiral fracture of the humerus. The caregiver states the injury occurred while \"the baby was rolling around on the bed.\" Which of the following is the\u00a0most appropriate response?\nA. Reassure the caregiver that this is a common accident\nB. Refer to orthopaedics for cast placement only\nC. Recognize this injury as suspicious in a non-ambulatory child and notify safeguarding services\nD. Schedule outpatient follow-up in one week\nE. Accept the explanation and discharge the infant\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Recognize this injury as suspicious in a non-ambulatory child and notify safeguarding services\nExplanation:\u00a0Spiral fractures can occur in accidental trauma, but in a\u00a0non-ambulatory infant (i.e., one who cannot yet roll, crawl, or walk), such injuries raise significant concern. These fractures require a\u00a0torsional (twisting) force, which is unlikely to occur from passive movement like rolling.

Early action can prevent further harm or fatality.\nReferences:\nRoyal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH),\u00a0Child Protection Companion, 2013.\n\nWhy other options are inappropriate:\nA. Reassure the caregiver:\nThis may overlook potential abuse and risk further harm to the infant.\nB. Refer to orthopaedics for cast only:\nWhile orthopaedic management is needed, this ignores the safeguarding concern.\nD. Schedule outpatient follow-up:\nDelays in evaluation and safeguarding involvement may endanger the child.\nE. Accept explanation and discharge:\nDischarging without investigation fails to protect the infant and breaches safeguarding responsibilities.\n\nQuestion 2\nWhich of the following injury patterns is most suggestive of non-accidental injury in a child?\nA. Linear forehead bruise from a table corner\nB. Bilateral metaphyseal corner fractures\nC. Toddler\u2019s fracture of the tibia\nD. Greenstick fracture of the ulna after falling from a bicycle\nE. Small superficial abrasion on the shin\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Bilateral metaphyseal corner fractures\nExplanation:\u00a0Metaphyseal corner fractures\u00a0(also known as\u00a0classic metaphyseal lesions, or CMLs) are\u00a0highly specific\u00a0indicators of non-accidental trauma (NAT), particularly in infants and young children who are not yet ambulatory. These fractures occur at the growing ends of long bones, specifically at the\u00a0metaphysis, and involve a small piece of bone being avulsed due to\u00a0shearing, pulling, or twisting forces.\nThese forces are\u00a0not typically encountered during accidental trauma\u00a0(e.g., simple falls) but rather are\u00a0consistent with abuse, such as violent\u00a0shaking, jerking of limbs, or\u00a0forcibly pulling\u00a0on the child\u2019s arms or legs.\nReferences:\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Child Abuse and Neglect. Pediatrics. 2000;105(6):1345\u20131348.\n\n\nWhy the other options are less suspicious of NAI:\nA. Linear forehead bruise from a table corner:\nBruising on the forehead is a\u00a0common injury\u00a0in toddlers learning to walk and is consistent with an\u00a0accidental fall, especially if the story matches the developmental stage.\nC. Toddler\u2019s fracture of the tibia:\nThis is a\u00a0spiral fracture\u00a0of the tibia often seen in children aged 9 months to 3 years, typically due to\u00a0low-energy twisting injuries\u00a0like sliding or tripping while walking or running.\u00a0It is not specific for NAI.\nD. Greenstick fracture of the ulna after falling from a bicycle:\nGreenstick fractures are\u00a0incomplete fractures\u00a0seen in children due to the flexibility of their bones. This pattern is\u00a0typical of accidental trauma, especially with a clear, witnessed mechanism like a bike fall.\nE. Small superficial abrasion on the shin:\nThese are\u00a0very common injuries\u00a0in mobile children and not concerning in isolation. Superficial abrasions are expected with normal play.\nQuestion 3\nA 6-month-old infant is brought in with seizures. CT scan reveals subdural hematoma. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral retinal haemorrhages. There is no reported history of trauma. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nA. Accidental fall from a sofa\nB. Shaken baby syndrome\nC. Febrile seizure\nD. Vitamin K deficiency\nE. Coagulopathy\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Shaken baby syndrome\nExplanation:\u00a0The\u00a0triad of findings\u2014subdural hematoma,\u00a0retinal haemorrhages, and\u00a0absence of adequate trauma history\u2014is\u00a0highly suggestive of abusive head trauma (AHT), also known as\u00a0shaken baby syndrome (SBS).\n1. Subdural Hematoma:\nSeen on CT in infants who have been subjected to\u00a0violent shaking, causing rupture of\u00a0bridging veins\u00a0between the brain and dura mater.\nSubdural hematomas in this age group\u00a0rarely occur accidentally, especially without an appropriate trauma history.\nThe\u00a0infant brain\u00a0is particularly vulnerable due to a\u00a0relatively large head, weak neck muscles, and\u00a0incomplete myelination.\n\"Subdural hematoma is the most common intracranial lesion found in abusive head trauma.\"\n\u2014\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics. Pediatrics. 2001;108(1):206\u2013210.\n2. Retinal Hemorrhages:\nBilateral, multilayered retinal hemorrhages, especially in the\u00a0posterior pole and extending to the periphery, are\u00a0strong indicators of inflicted trauma.\nThese occur due to\u00a0acceleration-deceleration forces\u00a0and\u00a0increased intracranial pressure.\n\u201cRetinal hemorrhages are seen in over 80% of cases of shaken baby syndrome and are rare in accidental trauma.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Levin AV. Retinal hemorrhages and child abuse: the evidence. Curr Opin Ophthalmol. 2010;21(5):460\u2013466.\n3. Seizures:\nSeizures are a common presenting symptom in abusive head trauma due to\u00a0intracranial bleeding and brain injury.\nSeizures in infants\u00a0without fever or trauma\u00a0always warrant neuroimaging and further investigation for abuse.\n\n\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\nA. Accidental fall from a sofa:\nLow-height falls (under 1.5 meters) are\u00a0unlikely to cause subdural hematoma with retinal haemorrhages. If the injury is\u00a0disproportionate to the history provided, child abuse must be considered.\nC. Febrile seizure:\nThese occur in older infants and toddlers (typically\u00a06 months to 5 years) and are\u00a0generalized tonic-clonic seizures associated with fever\u2014not\u00a0subdural bleeding or retinal haemorrhages.\nD. Vitamin K deficiency:\nCan lead to\u00a0bleeding, especially in newborns, but this usually presents earlier (within the first few weeks of life), and the\u00a0bleeding pattern\u00a0is typically more generalized (e.g., GI or skin, not just intracranial and retinal).\nE. Coagulopathy:\nWhile coagulopathies can cause bleeding, they usually present with a\u00a0history of bleeding tendency\u00a0(e.g., easy bruising, mucosal bleeding) and would\u00a0not explain the specific pattern\u00a0of\u00a0bilateral retinal haemorrhages and subdural hematoma.\n\n\nQuestion 4\nWhich of the following is the\u00a0most appropriate next step\u00a0when child abuse is suspected in a clinical setting?\nA. Document findings in the notes and observe\nB. Confront the caregiver immediately\nC. Notify child protective services or the safeguarding team\nD. Discharge the child with close follow-up\nE. Wait for confirmatory imaging before acting\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Notify child protective services or the safeguarding team\n\nExplanation:\u00a0When child abuse is suspected, the\u00a0immediate priority is to ensure the child\u2019s safety\u00a0and initiate a thorough, multi-disciplinary safeguarding process.\nWhy notify child protective services or safeguarding team?\nLegal obligation:\nHealthcare professionals are\u00a0mandated reporters\u00a0in many countries, meaning they are legally required to\u00a0report any reasonable suspicion of child abuse\u00a0to the appropriate authorities.\nChild safety:\nEarly involvement of safeguarding teams ensures\u00a0prompt assessment, investigation, and protection of the child. Delays can increase the risk of further harm and death. \nExpert assessment:\nThe safeguarding team usually includes social workers, paediatricians, and sometimes law enforcement, providing a comprehensive approach.\n\u201cHealthcare professionals should report suspected abuse promptly and share concerns with appropriate child protection agencies without delay.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) Child Protection Companion, 2020\n\nWhy the other options are inappropriate or insufficient?\nA. Document findings in the notes and observe:\nWhile documentation is essential,\u00a0observation alone risks ongoing harm\u00a0if the child remains in a dangerous environment. Action must follow suspicion, not just documentation.\nB. Confront the caregiver immediately:\nConfronting the caregiver can\u00a0escalate the situation or cause the caregiver to flee, making it harder to protect the child and investigate safely. The approach should be cautious and often led by social services or law enforcement.\nD. Discharge the child with close follow-up:\nDischarging without intervention\u00a0places the child at risk. Follow-up alone is insufficient when abuse is suspected.\nE. Wait for confirmatory imaging before acting:\nWaiting for investigations delays intervention and\u00a0does not remove the legal responsibility to report suspicion immediately. Imaging helps with diagnosis but should not delay safeguarding actions.\nQuestion 5\nWhich of the following injuries is\u00a0least\u00a0likely to be associated with non-accidental injury in children?\nA. Bucket-handle (corner) fractures\nB. Posterior rib fractures\nC. Scald burns with clear immersion lines\nD. Bruising over bony prominences in toddlers\nE. Retinal haemorrhages\nAnswer:\u00a0D. Bruising over bony prominences in toddlers\nExplanation:\u00a0Toddlers who are active and learning to walk frequently sustain minor accidental bruises, especially over bony prominences like the shins, knees, forehead, and elbows. These are expected and considered part of normal childhood play and exploration. Accidental bruises tend to be found on the front of the body, over bony areas where children are prone to bumping during normal activity.\nReferences:\n\u201cBruising over bony prominences in mobile children is common and usually accidental.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Pierce MC, et al. Clinical characteristics that distinguish abusive from nonabusive bruises in young children. Pediatrics. 2010.\n\n\nWhy other options are more indicative of NAI:\nA. Bucket-handle (corner) fractures:\nHighly specific for abuse, resulting from\u00a0shearing forces during shaking or twisting. Commonly seen in infants who are non-ambulatory.\nB. Posterior rib fractures:\nClassic injury due to\u00a0forceful squeezing or chest compression, rarely caused by accidental trauma in infants.\nC. Scald burns with clear immersion lines:\nBurns with\u00a0well-demarcated edges, uniform depth, and clear \u201clines of demarcation\u201d\u00a0suggest forced immersion in hot liquid, consistent with abuse.\nE. Retinal haemorrhages:\nStrongly associated with\u00a0shaken baby syndrome\u00a0and abusive head trauma; very uncommon in accidental injuries.\n\n\nQuestion 6\nA 4-year-old child presents with bruising in various stages of healing. Which of the following patterns is most concerning for non-accidental injury?\nA. Bruises over knees and elbows\nB. Linear bruises on the back and buttocks\nC. Small bruises over shins\nD. Bruising from seatbelt marks in a car crash\nE. A single forehead bruise from running into a door\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Linear bruises on the back and buttocks\nExplanation:\u00a0Linear bruises on the back and buttocks are not most concerning because: \nUnusual location for accidental bruising:\nThe back and buttocks are\u00a0areas less likely to be injured accidentally\u00a0during normal play, especially in ambulatory children. Accidental bruises are typically found on\u00a0bony prominences at the front of the body, like knees, shins, and elbows.\nLinear pattern suggests impact with an object:\nLinear bruises can be caused by\u00a0blunt objects such as sticks, belts, rods, or straps. This pattern of injury is consistent with\u00a0intentional infliction of trauma.\nBruising in various stages of healing:\nMultiple bruises of different ages suggest\u00a0repeated episodes of trauma, a red flag for ongoing abuse.\n\u201cBruising in protected areas such as the back and buttocks, especially with linear or patterned marks, is highly suspicious for abuse.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Jenny C.\u00a0Child Abuse and Neglect: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Evidence. 2010.\n.\n\nWhy the other options are less concerning or consistent with accidental trauma:\nA. Bruises over knees and elbows:\nCommonly seen in active children and toddlers learning to walk or run; usually accidental.\nC. Small bruises over shins:\nSimilar to knees and elbows, these are typical accidental bruises from normal activities.\nD. Bruising from seatbelt marks in a car crash:\nExpected and consistent with history of trauma in a car accident; not suspicious if the history matches the injury.\nE. A single forehead bruise from running into a door:\nCommon minor injury, especially in toddlers and young children, and consistent with the history.\n\nQuestion 7\nWhich radiological investigation is\u00a0most appropriate\u00a0when non-accidental injury is suspected in a child under 2 years of age?\nA. MRI of the head\nB. Ultrasound of abdomen\nC. Skeletal survey\nD. Bone scan\nE. CT scan of abdomen\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Skeletal survey\nExplanation:\u00a0A skeletal survey is standard in children under 2 when NAI is suspected, as it can identify occult fractures. Explained below\nPurpose:\nA skeletal survey is a\u00a0systematic series of X-rays\u00a0of the entire skeleton. It is designed to\u00a0detect both recent and old fractures, including occult (hidden) fractures that are not clinically apparent.\nIdentification of classic abusive fractures:\nThe skeletal survey can identify highly specific injuries for abuse, such as\u00a0metaphyseal corner (bucket-handle) fractures, posterior rib fractures, and fractures in various stages of healing.\nGuidelines:\nInternational child protection guidelines recommend a skeletal survey as\u00a0first-line imaging\u00a0when abuse is suspected in infants and young children under 2 years.\n\u201cThe skeletal survey is essential in the assessment of suspected physical abuse in children under 2 years, to detect occult fractures and establish the extent of injury.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0Royal College of Radiologists and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidelines, 2014.\n\nWhy other options are less appropriate:\nA. MRI of the head:\nMRI is excellent for\u00a0brain injury evaluation, especially for suspected abusive head trauma, but is\u00a0not a screening tool for skeletal injuries.\nB. Ultrasound of abdomen:\nUseful for evaluating abdominal organ injury, but\u00a0not for detecting fractures.\nD. Bone scan:\nBone scintigraphy can detect fractures, but it is\u00a0less specific\u00a0and less widely used than skeletal survey. It is sometimes used as an adjunct when skeletal survey is inconclusive.\nE. CT scan of abdomen:\nUseful for detecting internal organ injury but\u00a0does not identify skeletal injuries\u00a0and involves higher radiation exposure than other modalities.\n\nQuestion 8\nA 2-month-old presents with a femur fracture. There is no history of trauma, and the baby is not yet rolling over. What is the\u00a0most important initial step?\nA. Order a full blood count and calcium\nB. Refer to orthopedic surgery for traction\nC. Begin vitamin D supplementation\nD. Initiate a full safeguarding evaluation including a skeletal survey\nE. Observe the child overnight in hospital\nAnswer:\u00a0D. Initiate a full safeguarding evaluation including a skeletal survey\nExplanation:\u00a0Infants under 6 months who are not yet mobile (rolling, crawling, or walking) are very unlikely to sustain fractures accidentally, especially long bone fractures like the femur. In this context, a femur fracture without a history of trauma is a red flag for possible abuse. The absence of an adequate trauma explanation warrants a thorough child protection investigation.\nThis imaging series will identify other occult fractures that might not be clinically apparent, including metaphyseal fractures and rib fractures that are characteristic of abuse. Safeguarding evaluation involves paediatricians, social workers, and possibly law enforcement to assess the child's safety and well-being.\nReferences\nKemp AM, et al. Which injuries may indicate child abuse? A systematic review. Arch Dis Child. 2014;99(2):117-123.\nRoyal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Child Protection Companion. 2020.\n\nWhy the other options are less appropriate as first steps:\nA. Order a full blood count and calcium:\nWhile it\u2019s reasonable to consider metabolic bone disease or bleeding disorders, these tests alone do not exclude abuse and do not address immediate safeguarding concerns.\nB. Refer to orthopaedic surgery for traction:\nOrthopaedic management is necessary for fracture treatment but should\u00a0occur after ensuring the child is safe and that the cause of injury is investigated.\nC. Begin vitamin D supplementation:\nVitamin D deficiency could cause fractures but is unlikely without other signs such as rickets or biochemical abnormalities; more importantly, abuse must first be ruled out.\nE. Observe the child overnight in hospital:\nObservation does not address the need for a safeguarding investigation, which is urgent to prevent further harm.\n\nQuestion 9\nWhich of the following burn patterns is\u00a0most suspicious\u00a0for inflicted injury?\nA. Asymmetric splash burns on the chest\nB. Circular cigarette burns on the arm\nC. Burn from hot soup spill on lap\nD. Reddened palms after touching a stove\nE. Mild sunburn on the shoulders\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Circular cigarette burns on the arm\nExplanation:\u00a0Discrete, uniform burns like cigarette burns are highly suspicious for abuse. Accidental cigarette burns tend to be\u00a0superficial and irregular, often occurring when someone flinches or pulls away. In contrast, inflicted cigarette burns suggest\u00a0deliberate contact and sustained pressure, which children do not tolerate passively.\n\nWhy the other options are less suspicious:\nA. Asymmetric splash burns on the chest:\nThese are often\u00a0accidental, commonly caused by toddlers pulling down hot liquids. The irregular pattern and asymmetry are typical of such injuries.\nC. Burn from hot soup spill on lap:\nThis pattern may occur\u00a0accidentally\u00a0when a child spills a bowl or cup of hot liquid. Usually irregular in shape with varying depth.\nD. Reddened palms after touching a stove:\nThough painful, this is often\u00a0accidental\u00a0in curious toddlers who momentarily touch a hot surface. Usually presents as\u00a0superficial erythema, not deep burns.\nE. Mild sunburn on the shoulders:\nVery common and entirely\u00a0non-suspicious\u00a0unless accompanied by unusual patterns or in non-sun-exposed areas (which would be rare).\n\n\nQuestion 10\nWhich of the following is a common\u00a0perpetrator\u00a0in cases of non-accidental injury?\nA. Stranger\nB. Friend\nC. Primary caregiver\nD. Teacher\nE. Healthcare worker\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Primary caregiver\nExplanation:\u00a0Epidemiological data consistently show\u00a0that the majority of non-accidental injuries (NAI) are inflicted by individuals\u00a0closest to the child, typically\u00a0parents or primary caregivers\u00a0(e.g., biological parents, stepparents, or live-in partners). These individuals are:\nMost frequently present\u00a0with the child,\nIn control of the child\u2019s environment, and\nOften responsible for discipline or caregiving, which may escalate into abusive behaviour in high-stress or dysfunctional settings.\nReferences: \n\u201cThe vast majority of abused children are harmed by someone they know and trust\u2014most commonly a parent or parental figure.\u201d\n\u2014\u00a0World Health Organization, Child Maltreatment Factsheet, 2020\n\nWhy the other options are less likely:\nA. Stranger:\nWhile stranger abuse is possible (e.g., abduction, sexual abuse), it is\u00a0rare\u00a0in cases of\u00a0physical abuse or NAI, especially in infants and toddlers.\nB. Friend:\nChildren\u2019s peers or friends may be involved in fights or accidents, but not typically in\u00a0systematic or intentional injury\u00a0consistent with abuse.\nD. Teacher:\nWhile institutional abuse can occur,\u00a0teachers are rarely responsible\u00a0for the types of injuries typically seen in NAI. Teachers are often\u00a0key reporters, not perpetrators.\nE. Healthcare worker:\nAbuse by healthcare professionals is exceedingly rare and typically falls under\u00a0medical misconduct or neglect, not physical NAI.\n\n\nQuestion 11\nWhich of the following statements is\u00a0true\u00a0regarding bruises in infants?\nA. Any bruising in a non-mobile infant is normal\nB. Bruising is common in infants under 6 months\nC. Bruising in non-mobile infants should always raise suspicion\nD. Bruising is never a concern in any child\nE. Bruising over shins in a crawling infant is highly suspicious\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Bruising in non-mobile infants should always raise suspicion\nExplanation:\u00a0Non-mobile infants rarely bruise; any such finding should prompt consideration of abuse.\n\nWhy the other statements are incorrect:\nA. Any bruising in a non-mobile infant is normal:\n\u274c False. It is\u00a0abnormal\u00a0in non-mobile infants and often a\u00a0red flag\u00a0for abuse.\nB. Bruising is common in infants under 6 months:\n\u274c False. Bruising is\u00a0uncommon\u00a0in infants under 6 months unless they are mobile. If present, it should raise\u00a0safeguarding concerns.\nD. Bruising is never a concern in any child:\n\u274c False. Bruising can be\u00a0accidental in older children, but location, pattern, and context matter. Bruises in unusual places or without a clear explanation are always concerning.\nE. Bruising over shins in a crawling infant is highly suspicious:\n\u274c False. Shins are\u00a0common sites for accidental bruising\u00a0in mobile children. Bruises over\u00a0bony prominences\u00a0in active toddlers are usually\u00a0benign.\n\n\nQuestion 12\nA 3-year-old presents with a scald burn with a clear \"stocking\" distribution on both legs. What is the most likely cause?\nA. Accidental hot water splash\nB. Intentional immersion in hot water\nC. Allergic reaction\nD. Contact dermatitis\nE. Infection\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Intentional immersion in hot water\nExplanation:\u00a0 \"Stocking\" distribution burns\u00a0refer to sharply demarcated scald injuries affecting both legs in a\u00a0symmetrical pattern, often extending from the feet up to the knees (like wearing socks or stockings). This pattern is\u00a0highly suspicious\u00a0for\u00a0forced immersion, where the child is held in hot water (e.g., in a bathtub or sink),\u00a0unable to escape. These burns have the following characteristics:\nHave\u00a0clear upper borders\u00a0(line of demarcation),\nAre often\u00a0bilaterally symmetrical, and\nMay involve\u00a0sparing in skin folds\u00a0or areas pressed against a cooler surface (known as \"zebra stripes\" or \"donut hole\" sign).\n\n\n Why the other options are incorrect:\nA. Accidental hot water splash:\nTypically produces\u00a0irregular, asymmetric burns\u00a0with\u00a0drip or splash patterns, not symmetrical, well-defined borders.\nC. Allergic reaction:\nWould present with\u00a0rash or hives, not burns or blistering.\nD. Contact dermatitis:\nUsually itchy and\u00a0diffuse, often triggered by irritants/allergens\u2014not consistent with full-thickness burns or symmetrical scalds.\nE. Infection:\nMay cause redness, warmth, and swelling but not\u00a0acute scald burns\u00a0with defined immersion lines.\n\n\n\nQuestion 13\nA child has multiple fractures in various stages of healing. What is the\u00a0next best step\u00a0in management?\nA. Discharge home with NSAIDs\nB. Reassure parents and arrange follow-up\nC. Refer to orthopaedic surgeon\nD. Report to safeguarding authorities and admit the child\nE. Treat pain and schedule outpatient review\nAnswer:\u00a0D. Report to safeguarding authorities and admit the child\nExplanation:\u00a0Multiple fractures at different stages raise significant concern for abuse; protection is the priority. This pattern indicates that:\nThe child has been\u00a0injured on more than one occasion, and\nThe\u00a0caregiver has either failed to seek timely medical care, or\nThere is a\u00a0pattern of inflicted injury\u00a0consistent with physical abuse.\nThe priority is\u00a0child safety\u00a0and\u00a0legal safeguarding with immediate admission\u00a0to hospital allows for safety and further medical evaluation, reporting to safeguarding authorities (e.g., child protective services or local safeguarding team)\u00a0is a\u00a0legal and ethical obligation\u00a0for healthcare providers, and a full\u00a0child protection workup\u00a0is indicated: skeletal survey, retinal exam, head imaging (if <2 years), and multidisciplinary review.\nReferences:\n \uf0b7  Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.\u00a0Child Protection Companion. 2020.\n\uf0b7  American Academy of Pediatrics.\u00a0Evaluating children with fractures for child physical abuse.\u00a0Pediatrics. 2014;133(2):e477\u2013e489.\n\n Why the other options are incorrect:\nA. Discharge home with NSAIDs:\nDangerous. Discharging a potentially abused child may result in further harm or death.\nB. Reassure parents and arrange follow-up:\nInappropriate. This delays intervention and fails to protect the child.\nC. Refer to orthopaedic surgeon:\nWhile orthopaedic input may be needed,\u00a0safeguarding takes precedence\u00a0and should occur\u00a0immediately, not just a specialty referral.\nE. Treat pain and schedule outpatient review:\nFails to address the underlying\u00a0safeguarding risk\u00a0and puts the child at continued risk of abuse.\nQuestion 14\nIn areas affected by armed conflict, which factor most increases the risk of non-accidental injury (NAI) in children?\nA. Increased access to healthcare services\nB. Disruption of family and social support systems\nC. Improved child protection laws\nD. Stable housing and schooling\nE. Enhanced nutritional programs\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Disruption of family and social support systems\nExplanation:\u00a0Armed conflict and war create\u00a0stressful environments\u00a0for families and communities. Key risk factors linked to increased\u00a0non-accidental injury (NAI)\u00a0in children during conflict include:\nDisruption of family units and social support\u00a0\u2014 loss of caregivers, displacement, and breakdown of community networks reduce supervision and increase vulnerability.\nIncreased caregiver stress and mental health issues\u00a0\u2014 poverty, trauma, and insecurity may increase risk of abuse.\nOverburdened or destroyed healthcare and social services\u00a0\u2014 limiting access to protective interventions.\nChildren in conflict zones are at higher risk of\u00a0neglect, physical abuse, and exploitation, including NAI. Protective systems such as schools and child welfare services are often compromised, increasing risk.\nReferences:\nUNICEF.\u00a0The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children. UNICEF Report, 2016.\nWHO.\u00a0Child Abuse and Neglect in Humanitarian Settings, 2018.\n\nWhy the other options are less likely:\nA. Increased access to healthcare services:\nRare in war zones; typically healthcare access decreases.\nC. Improved child protection laws:\nWhile important, enforcement is often weak or absent during conflict.\nD. Stable housing and schooling:\nUsually disrupted during war, increasing risks.\nE. Enhanced nutritional programs:\nNutritional aid helps overall health but does not directly reduce NAI risk without protective frameworks.\n\n\nQuestion 15\nA 7-month-old infant presents with posterior rib fractures and no trauma history. What mechanism likely explains these findings?\nA. Rolling off a bed\nB. Direct blow during a fall\nC. High-impact car crash\nD. Forceful chest compression from abuse\nE. Congenital bone disease\nAnswer:\u00a0D. Forceful chest compression from abuse\nExplanation:\u00a0Posterior rib fractures are strongly associated with squeezing the thorax in physical abuse. In this mechanism the ribs are pushed against the vertebral column, leading to posterior fractures at or near the costovertebral junction. This action often happens during shaken baby syndrome or other forms of blunt force trauma. \nReferences: \n\"Posterior rib fractures are extremely rare in accidental trauma and highly specific for abuse, particularly in infants.\" \u2014 American Academy of Pediatrics, 2014\n\nWhy the other options are incorrect:\nA. Rolling off a bed:\nTypically results in\u00a0minor injuries\u00a0such as soft tissue swelling or a single linear skull fracture\u2014not posterior rib fractures.\nB. Direct blow during a fall:\nEven in falls from moderate height,\u00a0rib fractures are rare in infants\u00a0because their bones are pliable. If they do occur, they are usually\u00a0lateral, not\u00a0posterior.\nC. High-impact car crash:\nMay cause rib fractures in older children, but in a\u00a0properly restrained infant, posterior rib fractures remain\u00a0unusual, and such trauma would usually be\u00a0reported or witnessed.\nE. Congenital bone disease (e.g., osteogenesis imperfecta):\nWhile such conditions may predispose to fractures, they\u00a0rarely cause isolated posterior rib fractures\u00a0without other signs (e.g., blue sclerae, multiple long bone fractures, family history).\n\nQuestion 16\nWhat is the\u00a0most important role\u00a0of the healthcare provider when child abuse is suspected?\nA. Treat the visible injuries only\nB. Confront the suspected abuser directly\nC. Ensure the child\u2019s immediate safety\nD. Wait for law enforcement\nE. Avoid documenting details until confirmed\nAnswer:\u00a0C. Ensure the child\u2019s immediate safety\nExplanation:\u00a0Child safety is paramount. Immediate documentation and referral are essential.\nWhen child abuse is suspected, the\u00a0most urgent and critical responsibility\u00a0of the healthcare provider is to\u00a0ensure the child's immediate safety.\nThis includes:\nRemoving the child from harm\u2019s way\u00a0(e.g., admitting to hospital or ensuring safe supervision)\nNotifying child protection/safeguarding services immediately\nInitiating a multidisciplinary evaluation\u00a0(including paediatricians, social workers, and safeguarding teams)\nDocumenting findings accurately and thoroughly\nThe provider is\u00a0not required to confirm the abuse, only to\u00a0suspect\u00a0it and act to protect the child.\nReferences: \nNICE Guideline NG76.\u00a0Child abuse and neglect. 2017.\n\n Why the other options are incorrect:\nA. Treat the visible injuries only:\nIncomplete. Treating physical injuries is essential but\u00a0not sufficient\u2014protection\u00a0from further harm is the priority.\nB. Confront the suspected abuser directly:\nNot advisable. This may\u00a0increase risk to the child,\u00a0jeopardize the investigation, and is not the provider's role.\nD. Wait for law enforcement:\nDangerous delay.\u00a0Safeguarding referrals\u00a0must be initiated by the clinician without waiting for police.\nE. Avoid documenting details until confirmed:\nIncorrect.\u00a0Accurate, objective documentation\u00a0of\u00a0history, physical findings, and concerns\u00a0is\u00a0crucial\u00a0and should be done\u00a0immediately, regardless of confirmation.\n\nQuestion 17\nWhich of the following is\u00a0most consistent\u00a0with accidental injury?\nA. Bruises over soft parts of the body\nB. Symmetrical burns\nC. Fracture inconsistent with developmental stage\nD. Single bruise over the forehead in a toddler\nE. Patterned bruises\nAnswer:\u00a0D. Single bruise over the forehead in a toddler\nExplanation:\u00a0Toddlers who are learning to walk or run frequently fall, often forward, leading to isolated bruises on the forehead, especially over the frontal bone. These injuries:\nAre usually singular\nOccur over bony prominences\nAre consistent with the child\u2019s developmental stage and activities\nReferences:\n\u201cBruising over bony areas like the forehead, shins, or knees in mobile toddlers is often accidental and expected.\u201d\u2014 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health\n\nWhy the other options are more suspicious for\u00a0non-accidental injury (NAI):\nA. Bruises over soft parts of the body\nSuspicious \u2014 Soft tissues like the\u00a0abdomen, buttocks, cheeks, neck, or inner thighs\u00a0are\u00a0not common sites for accidental bruising, especially in non-mobile infants.\nB. Symmetrical burns\nHighly suspicious \u2014 Symmetrical or\u00a0\u201cglove\u201d or \u201cstocking\u201d distribution\u00a0burns often suggest\u00a0forced immersion\u00a0in hot water (a form of inflicted injury).\nC. Fracture inconsistent with developmental stage\nConcerning \u2014 For example, a\u00a0femur fracture in a non-ambulatory infant\u00a0is unlikely to occur accidentally and should prompt investigation.\nE. Patterned bruises\nRed flag \u2014 Bruises with\u00a0recognizable patterns\u00a0(e.g. loop marks, handprints, belt buckles) strongly suggest\u00a0inflicted trauma\u00a0from an object.\n\nQuestion 18\nA 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with a spiral fracture of the right femur. His mother reports he fell while playing. Which of the following features most strongly raises suspicion of non-accidental injury?\nA. The child has a normal developmental history\nB. Spiral fracture in a non-ambulatory child\nC. Mother appears distressed and anxious\nD. No external bruising noted\nE. The child cries when handled\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Spiral fracture in a non-ambulatory child\nExplanation:\u00a0Spiral fractures may occur accidentally, but in non-ambulatory children (e.g., not yet walking), any fracture raises concern for NAI.\n\nWhy the other options are less indicative of abuse:\nA. The child has a normal developmental history:\nThis alone doesn\u2019t exclude abuse. Developmental history helps assess mobility but is not definitive without considering fracture context.\nC. Mother appears distressed and anxious:\nParental distress is common and does not necessarily correlate with abuse.\nD. No external bruising noted:\nAbsence of bruising does not exclude abuse, as fractures can occur without visible skin injuries.\nE. The child cries when handled:\nExpected behaviour in pain and not specific for abuse.\n\n\nQuestion 19\nWhich age group is most commonly affected by fracture from non-accidental injury (NAI) in children?\nA. Newborns (0\u20131 month)\nB. Infants under 1 year\nC. Toddlers (2\u20134 years)\nD. School-aged children (5\u201312 years)\nE. Adolescents (13\u201318 years)\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Infants under 1 year\nExplanation:\u00a0Abuse and NAI can occur at any age. Studies show that the\u00a0peak incidence of NAI\u00a0occurs between\u00a03 and 12 months of age.\n\uf0b7  This age group:\nCannot verbalize or defend themselves\nHas limited mobility, so injuries are less likely to be accidental\nIs more dependent on caregivers, increasing risk when caregivers are stressed or lack support\nStudies show that the\u00a0peak incidence of NAI\u00a0occurs between\u00a03 and 9 months of age.\nReference:\nKemp AM, Dunstan F, Harrison S, Morris S, Mann M, Rolfe K, Maguire S.\u00a0Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: systematic review. BMJ. 2008;337:a1518. doi:10.1136/bmj.a1518.\n\nQuestion 20\nA 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department with multiple bruises. Which of the following lab tests may be helpful in distinguishing abuse from medical conditions?\nA. LFTs\nB. Coagulation profile\nC. Renal function tests\nD. Blood glucose\nE. CRP\nAnswer:\u00a0B. Coagulation profile\nExplanation:\u00a0Multiple bruises in a child raise concerns for\u00a0non-accidental injury (NAI)\u00a0but also for\u00a0medical conditions\u00a0that can cause easy bruising. Bleeding and clotting disorders\u00a0such as:\nHemophilia A or B\nVon Willebrand disease\nPlatelet function defects\nVitamin K deficiency\nOther coagulopathies\ncan present with bruising that\u00a0mimics physical abuse. Identifying or excluding bleeding disorders is critical to avoid misdiagnosing abuse and ensure appropriate treatment.\n\nWhy the other options are less relevant:\nA. LFTs (Liver function tests):\nMay be abnormal in liver disease which can cause coagulopathy but are not first-line for bruising.\nC. Renal function tests:\nNot directly related to bruising or bleeding tendencies.\nD. Blood glucose:\nHypoglycaemia does not cause bruising.\nE. CRP (C-reactive protein):\nMarker of inflammation/infection; not related to bleeding or bruising.\n\n",
      "pred": "\u00a0spiral fracture.\nExplanation:\u00a0Spiral fractures can occur in accidental trauma, but in a\u00a0non-ambulatory infant (i.e., one who cannot yet roll, crawl, or walk), such injuries raise significant concern. These fractures require a\u00a0torsional (twisting) force, which is unlikely to occur from passive movement like rolling. Therefore, this presentation must raise red flags for\u00a0non-accidental trauma. Safeguarding services (social work, child protection team) should be notified\u00a0immediately. Early action can prevent further harm or fatality.\nExplanation:\u00a0Spiral fractures can occur in accidental trauma, but in a\u00a0non-ambulatory infant (i.",
      "ref": "The document presents a series of clinical scenarios involving injuries in infants, focusing on the identification of potential non-accidental trauma (NAT). \n\n**Question 1** describes a 7-month-old infant with a spiral humeral fracture. The caregiver claims the injury occurred while the baby was rolling on the bed. The most appropriate response is to recognize the injury as suspicious for abuse and notify safeguarding services (Option C). This is because spiral fractures in non-ambulatory infants typically require significant force, raising concerns of non-accidental trauma. Other options, such as reassuring the caregiver or simply referring for orthopedic treatment, fail to address the safeguarding responsibilities.\n\n**Question 2** asks which injury pattern is most suggestive of non-accidental injury in a child. The correct answer is bilateral metaphyseal corner fractures (Option B), which are strong indicators of abuse, particularly in non-ambulatory infants. Other options, like linear forehead bruises or toddler's fractures, are more consistent with accidental injuries.\n\n**Question 3** introduces a 6-month-old infant with seizures, a CT scan showing subdural hematoma, and fundoscopy revealing bilateral retinal hemorrhages.
