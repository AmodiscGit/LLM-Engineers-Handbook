    "summary": "The document presents a series of clinical scenarios involving injuries in infants, focusing on the identification of potential non-accidental trauma (NAT). \n\n**Question 1** describes a 7-month-old infant with a spiral humeral fracture. The caregiver claims the injury occurred while the baby was rolling on the bed. The most appropriate response is to recognize the injury as suspicious for abuse and notify safeguarding services (Option C). This is because spiral fractures in non-ambulatory infants typically require significant force, raising concerns of non-accidental trauma. Other options, such as reassuring the caregiver or simply referring for orthopedic treatment, fail to address the safeguarding responsibilities.\n\n**Question 2** asks which injury pattern is most suggestive of non-accidental injury in a child. The correct answer is bilateral metaphyseal corner fractures (Option B), which are strong indicators of abuse, particularly in non-ambulatory infants. Other options, like linear forehead bruises or toddler's fractures, are more consistent with accidental injuries.\n\n**Question 3** introduces a 6-month-old infant with seizures, a CT scan showing subdural hematoma, and fundoscopy revealing bilateral retinal hemorrhages. While the document does not provide the answer or explanation for this scenario, it suggests a concern",
