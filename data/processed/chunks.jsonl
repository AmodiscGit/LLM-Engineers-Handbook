Shaken baby syndrome\nExplanation: The triad of findings—subdural hematoma, retinal haemorrhages, and absence of adequate trauma history—is highly suggestive of abusive head trauma (AHT), also known as shaken baby syndrome (SBS).\n1. Subdural Hematoma:\nSeen on CT in infants who have been subjected to violent shaking, causing rupture of bridging veins between the brain and dura mater.\nSubdural hematomas in this age group rarely occur accidentally, especially without an appropriate trauma history.\nThe infant brain is particularly vulnerable due to a relatively large head, weak neck muscles, and incomplete myelination.\n\"Subdural hematoma is the most common intracranial lesion found in abusive head trauma.\"\n— American Academy of Pediatrics.

Retinal Hemorrhages:\nBilateral, multilayered retinal hemorrhages, especially in the posterior pole and extending to the periphery, are strong indicators of inflicted trauma.\nThese occur due to acceleration-deceleration forces and increased intracranial pressure.\n“Retinal hemorrhages are seen in over 80% of cases of shaken baby syndrome and are rare in accidental trauma.”\n— Levin AV.

These injuries:\nAre usually singular\nOccur over bony prominences\nAre consistent with the child’s developmental stage and activities\nReferences:\n“Bruising over bony areas like the forehead, shins, or knees in mobile toddlers is often accidental and expected.”— Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health\n\nWhy the other options are more suspicious for non-accidental injury (NAI):\nA.
